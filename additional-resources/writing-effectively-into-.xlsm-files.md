# ✍️ Writing effectively into .xlsm files

The `.xlsm` file format includes macro code that enables the Multiselect feature in Impler. Due to varying security protocols on different operating systems, there are specific steps to follow to ensure these macros run effectively.

## Windows

Microsoft Excel on Windows restricts macro execution by default due to security concerns. Follow these steps to enable macros and use the Multiselect feature:

### Steps to Enable Macros in Excel

1. **Download the Sample File**:
   1. First, download the sample file generated by Impler. If any column has Multiselect enabled, it will be in `.xlsm` format.
   2.  By default, Microsoft Excel displays an `Security Risk` error for such files in its latest versions.

2. **Mark the File as Safe**:
   1. Navigate to the file location.
   2. Right-click on the `.xlsm` file and select `Properties`.
   3. In the Properties window, under the `Security` section, check the `Unblock` checkbox.
   4.  Click `Apply`.

3.  **Enable Macros**:

    * Open the file in Microsoft Excel.
    * An orange banner will appear at the top, indicating that macros are disabled.
    * Click on `Enable Content` it to allow the macros to run.

These steps will ensure that the macro code for the Multiselect feature is enabled, allowing you to select multiple options within the specified columns.

## Linux

Linux users typically use LibreOffice Calc, which does not run macro code by default. However, you can still work with the Multiselect feature by manually entering options.

### Steps for LibreOffice Calc

1.  **Open the .xlsm File**:

    * Open the `.xlsm` file in LibreOffice Calc.
    * A warning message about macros will appear.

2. **Manually Enter Options**:
   * Since macros do not run in LibreOffice Calc, you need to manually type in the options for Multiselect.
   * For example, if you are entering countries, you can write `New York,India,Canada` in the cell.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the Multiselect feature in `.xlsm` files on both Windows and Linux.

## Summary

#### Windows:

* Download the `.xlsm` file.
* Mark the file as safe through Properties.
* Enable macros in Excel to use the Multiselect feature.

#### Linux:

* Open the `.xlsm` file in LibreOffice Calc.
* Manually type the options in multiselect fields.
