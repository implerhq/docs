  to help them build rich data import experience without constantly reinventing
  the wheel.

# Introduction

## Why?

The ability to import data is often needed in the application. It usually starts the same, reading `.csv` or `.xlsx` file and insert records into the database. But after a while, you'll find yourself looping over large files, validating rows, and providing support for file types that you've never heard of before.

Impler's goal is to help developers create an efficient and smooth data import experience between the product and its users. All with an easy-to-use API and outstanding developer experience.

## Integrated into your Product

Integrating the import widget into your product can take just a few minutes. The feature-rich experience of the widget makes the data onboarding experience fun for users. Users can map columns and even review invalid records in their spreadsheets so that the right data gets imported.

As developers, we tend to care about the performance of the application, but following the growing number of file types support, mapping, and data validation become a burden on the team and make life hard.

## Open Source

One of the reasons for making Impler open-source was to ensure privacy and give back to the community. We heard from many teams and we also felt `How hard it's to give support for Data import functionality`. So to make it accessible to everyone, we decided to build the Impler with awesome people like you.
