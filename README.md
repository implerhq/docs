  to help them build rich data import experience without constantly reinventing
  the wheel.

# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

## Why? ðŸ¤”

The ability to import data is often needed in the application. It usually starts with reading a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file and inserting records into the database. But after a while, you'll find yourself looping over large files, validating rows, and providing support for file types you've never heard of.

## Goal  ðŸ¥…

Help developers create an efficient and smooth data import experience between the product and its users with an easy-to-use API and outstanding developer experience.

## Integrated into your Product ðŸš€

Integration of the import widget in your product can take a few minutes. A feature-rich experience of the widget makes the data onboarding experience fun for users. Users can map columns and even review invalid records in their spreadsheets so that the right data gets imported.

As developers, we tend to care about the performance, but following the growing number of file types support, mapping, and data validation become a burden on the team and make life hard.

## Free and Open Source 

One of the reasons for making Impler free was to give back to the community. We heard from many teams and felt `"How hard it is to support Data import functionality!"`. So to make it accessible to everyone, we decided to build the Impler with awesome people like you.
